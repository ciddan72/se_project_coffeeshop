Triple Peaks Coffe Shop

What I Learned from My Project
*HTML & CSS Basics – Building structure, styling with colors, fonts, spacing.
*Flexbox – Aligning and spacing elements easily.
*BEM Naming – Writing clean, maintainable class names.
*Responsive Design – Making the layout adapt to different screen sizes.
*Transitions & Hover Effects – Adding interactivity.
*File Structure & VS Code – Organizing code properly.
-Version Control (Git) – Tracking changes and managing code history.

I also learned to be more confident, patient, and consistent while coding.
